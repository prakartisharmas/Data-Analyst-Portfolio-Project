This repository presents my Data Analyst Portfolio Project, where I demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills by working on a real-world dataset and creating dashboards in three different applications: Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. The objective of this project is to show how the same dataset can be analyzed, processed, and visualized across multiple tools, highlighting flexibility and proficiency in handling diverse business intelligence platforms.


## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview:

The dataset used in this project provides insights into sales and profitability. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization, leading to the development of dashboards that summarize key performance indicators (KPIs).

Steps involved in the project:
* Data Cleaning & Preparation â€“ Removed duplicates, handled missing values, formatted dates, and standardized fields.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Generated summary statistics, identified trends, and explored relationships among variables.
* Dashboard Creation â€“ Designed and developed dashboards across three tools:
* Excel: Pivot tables, slicers, and charts for quick analysis.
* Power BI: Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visualizations.
* Tableau: Advanced visual storytelling, filters, and drill-down features.
